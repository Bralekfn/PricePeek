# Privacy Policy for PricePeek

PricePeek does not collect or store personal data.

We fetch data from CoinGecko to display crypto prices and gas fees. We do not track, save, or share user activity.

No user information is retained beyond Discord's basic identifiers used for functionality (e.g., user ID, server ID, etc.), and none of this data is stored externally.

If Discord API behavior changes, this policy may be updated.
